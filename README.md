# üé∂ Nightsound Audio

**Nightsound Audio** is an open-source project with the vision to create a tool that enhances movie and series audio by dynamically adjusting sound levels. Currently in the development phase for an MVP, we are excited to connect with contributors passionate about audio engineering, digital signal processing, machine learning, and cross-platform development!

---

## üåü Project Overview

**Nightsound Audio** aims to improve the audio experience by amplifying dialogue while reducing loud sound effects, ideal for late-night viewing or shared living spaces. This will allow users to enjoy clear audio at comfortable levels without disturbing others.

---

## üß© Core Features and Concepts

- **Dynamic Volume Adjustment**: Adjust volume dynamically to enhance clarity in dialogue and moderate sound effects.
- **Offline Processing**: The MVP focuses on offline audio file processing. Users can input a media file, and Nightsound Audio will output a modified version with optimized volume levels.
- **Future Real-Time Capabilities**: Although initially offline, the long-term goal is to offer real-time sound adjustments for streaming and system audio.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly across multiple operating systems.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

For the MVP, **Nightsound Audio** will leverage:

- **C++** for high-performance audio processing.
- **Audio Segmentation**: Processing audio in segments to enable efficient parallelization.
- **Filtering and DSP**: Utilizing frameworks like **PortAudio** and potentially **FFmpeg** for applying filters that enhance dialogue while softening loud effects.
- **Future ML Integration**: Machine learning models will eventually assist in distinguishing speech from background sounds, enabling more advanced dynamic adjustments.

## üöÄ Roadmap

1. **File Selection and Management**: Enable users to select an audio or video file for processing.
2. **Audio Segmentation and Preprocessing**: Divide audio for detailed analysis and parallel processing.
3. **Speech and Sound Effects Filtering**: Implement filters that amplify speech and dampen effects, with thresholds or ML-powered approaches.
4. **Output**: Export the enhanced audio file ready for playback.

## üôå Contributors Needed

To bring **Nightsound Audio** to life, we are looking for support in the following areas:

- **C++ Developers**: Especially those with expertise in audio processing or DSP.
- **Audio Engineers**: To fine-tune sound processing and enhance dialogue/effects separation.
- **Machine Learning Specialists**: For future implementations of real-time speech recognition and filtering.
- **UX/UI Developers**: To design a user-friendly interface for the application.
