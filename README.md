# Nightsound Audio1

**Nightsound Audio** is a concept for an audio adjustment software designed to enhance the listening experience for users enjoying films and series. Currently in the planning phase, we are seeking contributors to bring expertise and fresh ideas to the team. Since I’m not a professional sound designer or an experienced software developer, any support is welcome!

---

## Project Idea

The goal of Nightsound Audio is to dynamically adjust volume levels, amplifying dialogue in movies and series while reducing the impact of loud sound effects. This would be particularly useful in environments with thin walls or for evening use when moderate sound levels are preferred.

---

## Key Concepts

The main concepts behind Nightsound Audio include:

- **Dynamic Volume Adjustment**: Boosting dialogue segments and reducing background noise and sound effects.
- **Compatibility with DRM-Protected Content**: Primarily optimized for platforms like Netflix that host DRM-protected content.
- **System-Wide Application**: Ideally, this would be a cross-platform solution that integrates seamlessly across operating systems.

---

## Planned Tech Stack

As we’re still in the concept phase, the tech stack is not yet final. However, current ideas include:

- **Audio Framework**: Possible implementation using **PortAudio** or **Wasapi** for audio stream processing and control.
- **User Interface**: A simple, cross-platform GUI, likely in **C# .NET MAUI**, to provide a flexible and modern user experience.
- **Machine Learning**: Potential use of machine learning models to analyze and filter voice and sound segments.

## Looking for Contributors!

Since I have limited experience in sound engineering and software development for audio applications, I’m looking for support in the following areas:

1. **Sound Designers**: To help with developing and optimizing audio processes, particularly for improved speech/effects separation.
2. **Audio Engineers**: Experienced in real-time audio processing and adjustment.
3. **Software Developers with C# and Cross-Platform Development Focus**: To drive the technical implementation of the idea and create a user-friendly GUI.
4. **Machine Learning Experts**: To implement effective analysis of audio streams for dynamic real-time adjustments.

## Status

The project is currently in the concept phase. We’re gathering ideas and considering the best technologies and approaches to optimize the functionality.

The only existing file in the project is the **README.md**.
